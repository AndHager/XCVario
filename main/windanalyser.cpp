  About Wind analysis

  Currently, the wind is analyzed by finding the minimum and the maximum
  ground speeds measured while flying a circle. The direction of the wind is taken
  to be the direction in which the speed reaches it's maximum value, the speed
  is half the difference between the maximum and the minimum speeds measured.
  A quality parameter, based on the number of circles already flown (the first
  circles are taken to be less accurate) and the angle between the headings at
  minimum and maximum speeds, is calculated in order to be able to weigh the
  resulting measurement. This method do not more work for wind speeds < 5Km/h.

  There are other options for determining the wind speed. You could for instance
  add all the vectors in a circle, and take the resulting vector as the wind speed.
  This is a more complex method, but because it is based on more heading/speed
  measurements by the GPS, it is probably more accurate. If equipped with
  instruments that pass along airspeed, the calculations can be compensated for
  changes in airspeed, resulting in better measurements. We are now assuming
  the pilot flies in perfect circles with constant airspeed, which is of course
  not a safe assumption.
  The quality indication we are calculation can also be approached differently,
  by calculating how constant the speed in the circle would be if corrected for
  the wind speed we just derived. The more constant, the better. This is again
  more CPU intensive, but may produce better results.

  Some of the errors made here will be averaged-out by the WindStore, which keeps
  a number of wind measurements and calculates a weighted average based on quality.
