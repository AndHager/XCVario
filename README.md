# OpenIVario
ESP32 based lean Variometer system with OpenVario Interface

At the begin i want to show a short Demo of the variometer, including sensitivity and full sunlight test, followed by an explanation of various setup options and how to use. Its now the third year of this project, moving now to a colored display this winter we built a low number of devices with a 3D printed housing, but depending on followers demands, we may do a bigger lot in near future.

The project is dedicated to my new flight computer development using ESP32 WROOM development board plus modern sensors such as BMP280, DS1820b, MP5004DP, and colored sunlight readable display display.
It delivers data in the well known and documented OperVario format to any flight computer running XC-Soar.

The design supports the follwing sensors:
* Outside Temperature
* Airspeed
* Variometer
* Barometric Altitude

The ESP32 module contains a bluetooth sender module, so we are able to transmit all data to XCSoar in [OpenVario format](https://github.com/iltis42/OpenIVario/blob/master/putty.log), so XCSoar can operate as full glide computer with TE-Vario, Barometric Altitude, Speed and more.

The Vario Prototype with 500 nits 2.4 inch IPS Technology LCD Display features a low power consumation of less that 1W, that equals to 70mA at 12.5V operating voltage. The Size is *68x68x15 mm* at the front, the body is *56mm* in diameter and about *12 cm* long behind the panel. Weigt is about *185 gramm*.

The Soft- and Hardware features:

- Easy QNH and McCready Adjustment
